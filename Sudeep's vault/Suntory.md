The document you've provided outlines the challenges, phases, deliverables, and stakeholders involved in migrating an intranet system. Here's a breakdown:

**Problems to Solve:**

1. **SharePoint on-premises**

- Limits communication capabilities.
- Issues with accessing old documents, low trust in searchable old content.
- Difficulty in user access to confidential content, requiring infrastructure team support for updates.
- Sales field team cannot access the intranet home page on iPads.
- Unclear content ownership.
- Compliance risk with old policies still being used.
- MS Teams is being used as a document storage platform without governance, leading to visibility issues when employees leave.

**Phases:**

- **Phase 1 (Q3 2024):** Completed tasks including defining the scope of "Sunny Bot" and content migration vs. archive decisions.
- **Phase 2 (Q4 2024):** Ongoing tasks include global alignment on intranet framework/design and homepage design updates.
- **Phase 3 (Q1 2025):** Upcoming tasks like providing better policy navigation, governance, and mobile-friendly navigation.
- **Phase 4 (Q2 2025):** Future tasks like improving search/access to apps, analytics, and integrating social enterprise elements.

**Deliverables:**

- Sunny Bot scope, menu following employee lifecycle, department content owners identification, policy navigation, mobile-friendly navigation, training integration, and improving search and app access.

**Stakeholders/SMEs (Subject Matter Experts):**

- Involved departments include Corporate Affairs, Finance, Legal, Compliance & Risk, Marketing, People & Culture, etc.
- Specific people like Suzanne, Norma Lum, and Richard Ellis are identified as stakeholders for various teams and tasks.
- Field teams using iPads, merchandisers, and account managers are noted for their specific access needs.

**Key Initiatives:**

- **Entra SSO roll-out:** Scheduled for September 2024 for non-email users.
- **Global collaboration:** With Suntory Global Spirits for access by Q2 2025.
- **Workplace decommissioning:** Scheduled by mid-2025, with an alternative solution currently being selected.

This document is a strategic outline for migrating an intranet from an on-premises SharePoint solution to a more modern, flexible, and mobile-friendly platform, with phases detailing specific tasks and timelines. The focus is on improving accessibility, governance, and user experience across different teams and roles.
